# The Misterious Artifact: A collaborative story
------------------------------------

Although many had tried, no one succeded again. 
The Artifact remained unopened, 
and yet to be discovered was the mistery of its content. Until one day...

... it was actually not just one day. It was many, in many
different parallel universes, all happening at the same time.
The interdimensional journey begins...

...on a friday. The Artifact was shining particularly bright this evening.
Bengt, one of the local blacksmiths, approached the Artifact.
He pulled out his axe and swung it, with all the power he had left, towards the Artifact...
But the Artifact did not budge
