# The Squonk: A collaborative story
------------------------------------

In a faraway future, in a distant land  
lives the *Squonk*

Many people thinks Squonks do not exist!
But they do.
The average Squonk is 7 meters tall and screams loud.

the Squonk is yellow and covered in scales. It hisses uncontrollably. 
It once met a blue Squonk. He lives in a blue world. He saw the Drowsloks and he hissed at them angrily

The call of a Squonk can be heard miles away, warning you to stay away. (As most try to live a Squonk-free life, the noise is a mild annoyance at best)

Not that they are dangerous in any way, quite the opposite.

The Squonk is a very friendly and fluffy creature. 
Once you get used to the screaming (which hardly anyone does) you wont be able to stop cuddling your Squonk.

`Well... your turn now.`
