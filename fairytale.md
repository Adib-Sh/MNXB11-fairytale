# The Squonk: A collaborative story
------------------------------------

In a faraway future, in a distant land  
lives the *Squonk*

The average Squonk is 7 meters tall and screams loud.

I think Squonks do not exist!


Anyway, I think that this creature is rather similar to the Tasmamian devil; however, they seem gentle and clumsy, though, the funny figure and animal sound.
Squonk live in Pennsylvania where, time to time, use to encounter with their neighbourhood _Drowsloks_.
