# The Misterious Artifact: A collaborative story
------------------------------------

Although many had tried, no one succeded again. 
The Artifact remained unopened, 
and yet to be discovered was the mistery of its content. Until one day...

... it was actually not just one day. It was many, in many
different parallel universes, all happening at the same time.
The interdimensional journey begins to the best of our knowledge in the year 30 AD with the execution of Jesus of Nazareth by Pontius Pilate. The journey is that of mystery and great confusion for our characters in 1930s Moscow
