# The Squonk: A collaborative story
------------------------------------

In a faraway future, in a distant land  
lives the *Squonk*

The average Squonk is 7 meters tall and screams loud.
It is sometimes considered to be the origin of the word "squanch",
used in the popular television show Rick and Morty.
