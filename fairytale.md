# The Squonk: A collaborative story
------------------------------------

In a faraway future, in a distant land  
lives the *Squonk*

The average Squonk is 7 meters tall and screams loud.

`Well... your turn now.`
My story:
One day the Squonk decides to visit Canada. At first everything is fine
since there are a lot of unhabitated woods for it to move around in.
Eventually though, the Squonk wanders in to a big city and as you can 
imagine, **CHAOS**!
