# The Squonk: A collaborative story
------------------------------------

In a faraway future, in a distant land  
lives the *Squonk*

Many people think Squonks do not exist!
But they do.

Squonks are sometimes considered to be the origin of the word "squanch",
used in the popular television show Rick and Morty.

The average Squonk is 7 meters tall. Due to this, it usually does not
notice when Drowsloks hold marathons and races around its feet.

The Squonk is yellow and covered in scales. It hisses uncontrollably. 
It once met a blue Squonk. He lives in a blue world. He saw the Drowsloks and he hissed at them angrily.

Squonks scream loud. The call of a Squonk can be heard miles away, warning you to stay away. (As most try to live a Squonk-free life, the noise is a mild annoyance at best)
The etymology of the name Squonk comes from the fact this is an approximation of the sound a squonk makes and humans are not very creative at naming things.

Not that they are dangerous in any way, quite the opposite.

The Squonk is a very friendly and fluffy creature. 
Once you get used to the screaming (which hardly anyone does) you wont be able to stop cuddling your Squonk.
This is also why deaf creatures such as the Surdislok get along really well with the Squonks and protect them with their lives. 

One day the Squonk decides to visit Canada. At first everything is fine
since there are a lot of unhabitated woods for it to move around in.
Eventually though, the Squonk wanders in to a big city and as you can 
imagine, **CHAOS**!
