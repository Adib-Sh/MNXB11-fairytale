# The Misterious Artifact: A collaborative story
------------------------------------

Although many had tried, no one succeded again. 
The Artifact remained unopened, 
and yet to be discovered was the mistery of its content. Until that day.
As rumor has it the Artifact made by an ancient sorserer,
and would only open in times of greates need. 
Yet although the kingdom has been plaged with many tragidies over the centuries,
the Artifact has remained subbornly closed.


It was a picefull morning in grimholde.
The first beams of sun has just started to peek over the mountain tops to
east of the village. However early in the morning it was, you could already see
a boy leaveing the farmhouse on the outscurts of the village heading to the
forest in the north.
This boy, Vince, was heading out to collect firewood.
