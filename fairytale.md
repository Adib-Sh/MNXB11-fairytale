# The Squonk: A collaborative story
------------------------------------

In a faraway future, in a distant land  
lives the *Squonk*

The average Squonk is 7 meters tall and screams loud.

The etymology of the name Squonk comes from the fact this is an approximation of the sound a squonk makes and humans are not very creative at naming things.
