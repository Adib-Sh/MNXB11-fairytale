"I think we're done here" - said Xa-aX while returning in her pocket
the TikTok Broadcaster after recording the report. 

As she was doing so, a sudden ray of lighting reflected over the 
Fox Interstellar News logo on the device, blasting instant light on 
Zo-oZ's terrified expression. 

"I can believe what we've just seen" - said Zo-oZ - "I hope I will 
manage to get some sleep tonight..."

"I will" - replied Xa-aX - " it ain't the first time I record this 
stuff. I thought you said you were used to it!"

"Did I say...? Oh sure, sure! I've seen this before, no problem!" - 
answered Zo-oZ in a mix of shame and confusion.

As they stepped into the company's instaporter Zo-oZ could see the fear in Xa-aX's face. She is a young woman in his fifty's with brown eyes, dark hair and a well-defined jaw. We could consider Xa-aX as a pretty woman for the earthling but for the people in Athenea is an average person. 

-Are you okey?-asked Zo-oZ. He is almost 150 years, he is a tall man with grey hair, and a big smile. He is close to retirement after a career as a galaxy reporter, now he has to teach everything he knows to Xa-aX. 
-Yes, I am fine. It is just that I was shocked because of your reaction. -answered Xa-aX just before the instaporter started to work.

Few minutes later they were in Athenea, one of the Earth colonies'. As soon as they arrived to the instaporter's station a ship was waiting for them...
