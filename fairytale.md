"I think we're done here" - said Xa-aX while returning in her pocket
the TikTok Broadcaster after recording the report. 

As she was doing so, a sudden ray of lighting reflected over the 
Fox Interstellar News logo on the device, blasting instant light on 
Zo-oZ's terrified expression. 

"I can believe what we've just seen" - said Zo-oZ - "I hope I will 
manage to get some sleep tonight..."

"I will" - replied Xa-aX - " it ain't the first time I record this 
stuff. I thought you said you were used to it!"

"Did I say...? Oh sure, sure! I've seen this before, no problem!" - 
answered Zo-oZ in a mix of shame and confusion.

As they stepped into the company's instaporter...

They were met with their boss, Yn-nY, who appeared to be distraught in some manner. "I'm glad you're back this is urgent" - said Yn-nY.

Walking down the corridor towards Yn-nY's office, Xa-aX TikTok Brodcaster starts ringing. "Is it supposed to do that?" - said Zo-oZ.

"This have never happend before" - replied Xa-aX.

"Quickly! Destroy it! - yelled Yn-nY.

Without hesitating Xa-aX slammed it in the ground, shattering the device. "What is going on?!" - asked Zo-oZ, whilst still trying to keep it together. 

"This is way above our paygrade" - replied Yn-nY - "You must leave now and speak of this to no one!"

Exiting the instaporter no word was spoken. As Xa-aX and Zo-oZ left they briefly made eye contact before going their seperate ways...
