# The Squonk: A collaborative story
------------------------------------

In a faraway future, in a distant land  
lives the *Squonk*

The average Squonk is 7 meters tall and screams loud.

I think Squonks do not exist!

However, I think that this creature is a little similar to the Tasmamian devil, 
that seems ferocius and quite aggressive, though, the size.
He lives on the island of Tasmanian in the Pacific Ocean and migrates time to 
time to Pennsylvania, where he meet with his neighbourhood and friend _Drowsloks_.
