# The Squonk: A collaborative story
------------------------------------

In a faraway future, in a distant land  
lives the *Squonk*

The average Squonk is 7 meters tall and screams loud.

It has kind green eyes which does not reflect its personality 
since the Squonk mainly lives on a diet of fluffy puppies.

>  What does a Squonk **look like**?  
>  What does it **do**?  
>  What **happened** to **it**?  
>  What does the **world** he lives in **look like**?
>  What happened between it and the *Drowsloks*?

`Well... your turn now.`
