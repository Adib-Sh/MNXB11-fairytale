"I think we're done here" - said Xa-aX while returning in her pocket
the TikTok Broadcaster after recording the report. 

The TikTok Broadcaster made a chirp sound while shutting down.

As it was doing so, a sudden ray of lighting reflected over the 
Fox Interstellar News logo on the device, blasting instant light on 
Zo-oZ's eyes still wide open with terror. 

"I don't want to believe what we've just seen" - said Zo-oZ - "I hope I will 
manage to get some sleep tonight..."

"I will" - replied Xa-aX - " it ain't the first time I record this 
stuff. I thought you said you were used to it!"

"Did I say...? Oh sure, sure! I've seen this before, no problem!" - 
answered Zo-oZ in a mix of shame and confusion.

As they stepped into the company's instaporter, which would take them
back to the headquarters of the Fox Interstellar News Corporation in
New York City, Zo-oZ had a few minutes to reflect on the situation 
he found himself in right now. He wondered how Xa-aX had managed to 
keep her cool in the face of what they had just witnessed at the 
press room of the Johnson Space Center in Houston.
